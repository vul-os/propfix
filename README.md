# PropFix

### Building maintenance and inspections you actually own.

Raise a job against a unit, cost it, close it — and settle move-out damage with
**ingoing/outgoing inspection comparison** instead of an argument.
**One static binary, one SQLite file.** No cloud account, no subscription, no
external service.

## What is PropFix?

Maintenance and inspection software for people who look after property —
managing agents, landlords with a portfolio, body corporates, facilities teams.

It runs as **one binary and one SQLite file**. A tablet, a laptop, an office NAS
or a Raspberry Pi is a complete deployment. Copy the file, run it, done.

Two things it does that general ticketing tools do not:

**Costs are per door, not per ticket.** Every job belongs to a unit, and spend
and labour aggregate per building *and* per unit. Units are real records with a
normalised key, so `Flat 3A`, `3A` and `flat 3a` are one door rather than three
rows quietly fragmenting your reporting.

**Inspections compare.** Run an ingoing condition report at move-in and an
outgoing one at move-out, and PropFix diffs them item by item — what changed,
in which direction, and what degraded. Damage liability becomes evidence rather
than a disagreement.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vul-os/propfix && cd propfix
npm install && npm run build          # build the app
bash scripts/build-embedded.sh        # compile it into the binary
./backend/propfix --demo              # http://localhost:8080
```

Demo mode runs entirely in memory with a seeded portfolio — no database, no
configuration, nothing written to disk. Sign in as `demo@propfix.local` /
`demopassword`.

For a real deployment:

```bash
./backend/propfix --db /var/lib/propfix/propfix.db --addr 0.0.0.0:8080
```

The first account you register becomes the owner; registration then closes, and
further accounts are created by an authenticated operator. See
[SELFHOST.md](docs/SELFHOST.md).

## How it works

    UI["React app"]

  API <-->|"ops-<node>.jsonl"| USB
```

**The building is the authority.** Whoever manages a building owns its jobs, its
job numbering and its inspections. Because the only contended decision — who
does the work — has exactly one legitimate writer, there is no consensus
protocol, no leader election and no distributed lock anywhere in the system.

**Money and hours are append-only.** A job's cost is `SUM` over its ledger at
read time, never a stored column. Two people costing the same job while
offline therefore *add* rather than overwrite, and a correction is a negative
entry, so the audit trail is complete by construction.

**Peers are enrolled by hand.** No discovery, no rendezvous, no hub. An
operator enters another node's URL; requests are mutually signed with Ed25519.
For sites with no connectivity, each node appends only its own
`ops-<node>.jsonl` to a shared folder — so a NAS or a **USB stick** is a valid
transport with no possibility of a write conflict.

## Status

Honest per-area accounting. A feature that silently does nothing is worse than
one that says it is not built.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Jobs — raise, triage, assign, cost, close | **Built** |
| Buildings and units, unit normalisation | **Built** |
| Append-only cost and time ledgers | **Built** |
| Reports — per building, per unit | **Built** |
| Inspections — condition capture, completion | **Built** |
| Ingoing/outgoing comparison | **Built** |
| Auth, org scoping, first-run registration | **Built** |
| Peer sync — HTTP transport, Ed25519 envelopes, folder/USB | **Built**, not yet exercised beyond its test suite |
| WRAP `trades/v0` binding | **In progress** — cross-organisation work orders |
| Tenant portal | **Designed, not built.** The data model carries `public` vs `internal` event visibility; there is no tenant-facing surface yet |
| Photo attachments | **Partial** — references exist; content-addressed blob storage and replication are not built |
| Template versioning | **Open question.** Comparison tolerates template drift by pairing on item text; there is no formal versioning |
| Recurring / planned maintenance | **Not built** |
| Compliance certificates | **Not built** |

## Configuration

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--db` | `propfix.db` | SQLite file path |
| `--addr` | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `--demo` | off | In-memory demo data; forces `:memory:` so it can never touch a real database |
| `--sync-listen` | off | Accept sync from enrolled peers |
| `--sync-peer` | — | Peer URL to sync with |
| `--sync-folder` | — | Shared directory for file transport |

Every networked feature is off by default. A fresh install makes no outbound
connections.

style preferences and are not.
