// Package repo is the persistence layer: one file per aggregate, each owning
// its own SQL. There is no generic repository, no query builder and no god
// service (§9) — logic lives with its aggregate.
//
// The single rule every function in this package obeys: org_id is a parameter,
// it comes from the authenticated session, and it appears in the WHERE clause
// of every read and the values of every write. The legacy system took its
// organisation filter from a query parameter the frontend supplied, which meant
// tenant isolation was a client-side convention — anyone who could edit a URL
// could read another agency's portfolio. Isolation that a client can choose is
// not isolation (§11).
