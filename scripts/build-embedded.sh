# copied next to their embed directives and compiled in (build tag
# `embed_frontend`).
#
# The copies are needed because //go:embed cannot reach outside its own package
# directory, while dist/ and site/ live at the repo root where the frontend and
# site tooling expect them. A plain `go build ./...` skips all of this and uses
# app_dev.go / site_dev.go, which serve from disk — so developers and CI never
# need to run this.
